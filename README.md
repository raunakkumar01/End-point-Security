# End-point-Security


1. Create three virtual machines and configure them inline with the below mentioned details

>> -Showing clients & servers with false credentials that lead BOTs/APTs & malicious insider threats to the deception platform. Credential options like RDP, SSH, web cookies, SMB,    mail, web login information, browsers, FTP, memory cached credentials (LSASS), and SVN.

>>  -memory credentials, Active connectors, credential lures, SMB shares lures, Browser credentials and application credential

>>  -deceptive files (honey documents) to track data theft. Those files should be able to call back from inside or outside the network for alerting


2. Write an agent which will be installed in these virtual machines + monitor them + collect logs + filter/mutate logs + dispatch/publish logs to central server


3. Collect the logs at central server + create intelligence using ML + print/publish the results
